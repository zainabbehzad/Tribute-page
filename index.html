          <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologistsin Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.</p>
          <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>

            <ul id="tribute-info">
              <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa.</li>

              <br>
              <li><strong>1935</strong> -  Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>Conservation Corps,  helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1937</strong> -  Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1938</strong> -  Marries wife of 69 years <br>Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by  Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br> rejected. Instead, the militaryasked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1942</strong>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1944</strong>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of   disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1945</strong>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed,  creating a strain that responds well to <br>fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1962</strong>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1970</strong>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1983</strong>- helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br>  sorghum yields</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>1984</strong>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>2005</strong>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <br>that  genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and  animals for a long <br>time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>2009</strong>- dies at the age of 95.</li>
